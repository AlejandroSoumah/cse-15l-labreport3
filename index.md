                 Improve the Transitions between Administrations
            In chapter 6, we described the transition of 2000-2001. Beyond the policy issues we
                described, the new administration did not have its deputy cabinet officers in place
                until the spring of 2001, and the critical subcabinet officials were not confirmed
                until the summer-if then. In other words, the new administration- like others before
                it-did not have its team on the job until at least six months after it took office.

                Recommendation: Since a catastrophic attack could occur with little
                    or no notice, we should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national
                    security policymaking during the change of administrations by accelerating the
                    process for national security appointments. We think the process could be
                    improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new
                    officials to assume their new responsibilities as quickly as possible.


                Before the election, candidates should submit the names of selected members of
                    their prospective transition teams to the FBI so that, if necessary, those team
                    members can obtain security clearances immediately after the election is over.
                A president-elect should submit lists of possible candidates for national
                    security positions to begin obtaining security clearances immediately after the
                    election, so that their background investigations can be complete before January
                    20.
                A single federal agency should be responsible for providing and maintaining
                    security clearances, ensuring uniform standards-including uniform security
                    questionnaires and financial report requirements, and maintaining a single
                    database. This agency can also be responsible for administering polygraph tests
                    on behalf of organizations that require them.
                A president-elect should submit the nominations of the entire new national
                    security team, through the level of under secretary of cabinet departments, not
                    later than January 20. The Senate, in return, should adopt special rules
                    requiring hearings and votes to confirm or reject national security nominees
                    within 30 days of their submission. The Senate should not require confirmation
                    of such executive appointees below Executive Level 3.
                The outgoing administration should provide the president-elect, as soon as
                    possible after election day, with a classified, compartmented list that
                    catalogues specific, operational threats to national security; major military or
                    covert operations; and pending decisions on the possible use of force. Such a
                    document could provide both notice and a checklist, inviting a president-elect
                    to inquire and learn more.

            ORGANIZING AMERICA'S DEFENSES IN THE UNITED STATES
            The Future Role of the FBI
            We have considered proposals for a new agency dedicated to intelligence collection in
                the United States. Some call this a proposal for an "American MI- 5," although the
                analogy is weak-the actual British Security Service is a relatively small worldwide
                agency that combines duties assigned in the U.S. government to the Terrorist Threat
                Integration Center, the CIA, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security.
            The concern about the FBI is that it has long favored its criminal justice mission
                over its national security mission. Part of the reason for this is the demand around
                the country for FBI help on criminal matters. The FBI was criticized, rightly, for
                the overzealous domestic intelligence investigations disclosed during the 1970s. The
                pendulum swung away from those types of investigations during the 1980s and 1990s,
                though the FBI maintained an active counterintelligence function and was the lead
                agency for the investigation of foreign terrorist groups operating inside the United
                States.
            We do not recommend the creation of a new domestic intelligence agency. It is not
                needed if our other recommendations are adopted-to establish a strong national
                intelligence center, part of the NCTC, that will oversee counterterrorism
                intelligence work, foreign and domestic, and to create a National Intelligence
                Director who can set and enforce standards for the collection, processing, and
                reporting of information.
            Under the structures we recommend, the FBI's role is focused, but still vital. The
                FBI does need to be able to direct its thousands of agents and other employees to
                collect intelligence in America's cities and towns-interviewing informants,
                conducting surveillance and searches, tracking individuals, working collaboratively
                with local authorities, and doing so with meticulous attention to detail and
                compliance with the law. The FBI's job in the streets of the United States would
                thus be a domestic equivalent, operating under the U.S. Constitution and quite
                different laws and rules, to the job of the CIA's operations officers abroad.
            Creating a new domestic intelligence agency has other drawbacks.

                The FBI is accustomed to carrying out sensitive intelligence collection
                    operations in compliance with the law. If a new domestic intelligence agency
                    were outside of the Department of Justice, the process of legal oversight-never
                    easy-could become even more difficult. Abuses of civil liberties could create a
                    backlash that would impair the collection of needed intelligence.
                Creating a new domestic intelligence agency would divert attention of the
                    officials most responsible for current counterterrorism efforts while the threat
                    remains high. Putting a new player into the mix of federal agencies with
                    counterterrorism responsibilities would exacerbate existing information-sharing
                    problems.
                A new domestic intelligence agency would need to acquire assets and personnel.
                    The FBI already has 28,000 employees; 56 field offices, 400 satellite offices,
                    and 47 legal attach� offices; a laboratory, operations center, and training
                    facility; an existing network of informants, cooperating defendants, and other
                    sources; and relationships with state and local law enforcement, the CIA, and
                    foreign intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
                Counterterrorism investigations in the United States very quickly become
                    matters that involve violations of criminal law and possible law enforcement
                    action. Because the FBI can have agents working criminal matters and agents
                    working intelligence investigations concerning the same international terrorism
                    target, the full range of investigative tools against a suspected terrorist can
                    be considered within one agency. The removal of "the wall" that existed before
                    9/11 between intelligence and law enforcement has opened up new opportunities
                    for cooperative action within the FBI.
                Counterterrorism investigations often overlap or are cued by other criminal
                    investigations, such as money laundering or the smuggling of contraband. In the
                    field, the close connection to criminal work has many benefits.

            Our recommendation to leave counterterrorism intelligence collection in the United
                States with the FBI still depends on an assessment that the FBI-if it makes an
                all-out effort to institutionalize change-can do the job. As we mentioned in chapter
                3, we have been impressed by the determination that agents display in tracking down
                details, patiently going the extra mile and working the extra month, to put facts in
                the place of speculation. In our report we have shown how agents in Phoenix,
                Minneapolis, and New York displayed initiative in pressing their investigations.
            FBI agents and analysts in the field need to have sustained support and dedicated
                resources to become stronger intelligence officers. They need to be rewarded for
                acquiring informants and for gathering and disseminating information differently and
                more broadly than usual in a traditional criminal invetigation. FBI employees need
                to report and analyze what they have learned in ways the Bureau has never done
                before.
            Under Director Robert Mueller, the Bureau has made significant progress in improving
                its intelligence capabilities. It now has an Office of Intelligence, overseen by the
                top tier of FBI management. Field intelligence groups have been created in all field
                offices to put FBI priorities and the emphasis on intelligence into practice.
                Advances have been made in improving the Bureau's information technology systems and
                in increasing connectivity and information sharing with intelligence community
                agencies.
            Director Mueller has also recognized that the FBI's reforms are far from complete. He
                has outlined a number of areas where added measures may be necessary. Specifically,
                he has recognized that the FBI needs to recruit from a broader pool of candidates,
                that agents and analysts working on national security matters require specialized
                training, and that agents should specialize within programs after obtaining a
                generalist foundation. The FBI is developing career tracks for agents to specialize
                in counterterrorism/counterintelligence, cyber crimes, criminal investigations, or
                intelligence. It is establishing a program for certifying agents as intelligence
                officers, a certification that will be a prerequisite for promotion to the senior
                ranks of the Bureau. New training programs have been instituted for
                intelligence-related subjects.
            The Director of the FBI has proposed creating an Intelligence Directorate as a
                further refinement of the FBI intelligence program. This directorate would include
                units for intelligence planning and policy and for the direction of analysts and
                linguists.
            We want to ensure that the Bureau's shift to a preventive counterterrorism posture is
                more fully institutionalized so that it survives beyond Director Mueller's tenure.
                We have found that in the past the Bureau has announced its willingness to reform
                and restructure itself to address transnational security threats, but has fallen
                short-failing to effect the necessary institutional and cultural changes
                organization-wide. We want to ensure that this does not happen again. Despite having
                found acceptance of the Director's clear message that counterterrorism is now the
                FBI's top priority, two years after 9/11 we also found gaps between some of the
                announced reforms and the reality in the field. We are concerned that management in
                the field offices still can allocate people and resources to local concerns that
                diverge from the national security mission. This system could revert to a focus on
                lower-priority criminal justice cases over national security requirements.

                Recommendation: A specialized and integrated national security
                    workforce should be established at the FBI consisting of agents, analysts,
                    linguists, and surveillance specialists who are recruited, trained, rewarded,
                    and retained to ensure the development of an institutional culture imbued with a
                    deep expertise in intelligence and national security.


                The president, by executive order or directive, should direct the FBI to
                    develop this intelligence cadre.
                Recognizing that cross-fertilization between the criminal justice and national
                    security disciplines is vital to the success of both missions, all new agents
                    should receive basic training in both areas. Furthermore, new agents should
                    begin their careers with meaningful assignments in both areas.
                Agents and analysts should then specialize in one of these disciplines and
                    have the option to work such matters for their entire career with the Bureau.
                    Certain advanced training courses and assignments to other intelligence agencies
                    should be required to advance within the national security discipline.
                In the interest of cross-fertilization, all senior FBI managers, including
                    those working on law enforcement matters, should be certified intelligence
                    officers.
                The FBI should fully implement a recruiting, hiring, and selection process for
                    agents and analysts that enhances its ability to target and attract individuals
                    with educational and professional backgrounds in intelligence, international
                    relations, language, technology, and other relevant skills.
                The FBI should institute the integration of analysts, agents, linguists, and
                    surveillance personnel in the field so that a dedicated team approach is brought
                    to bear on national security intelligence operations.
                Each field office should have an official at the field office's deputy level
                    for national security matters. This individual would have management oversight
                    and ensure that the national priorities are carried out in the field.
                The FBI should align its budget structure according to its four main
                    programs-intelligence, counterterrorism and counterintelligence, criminal, and
                    criminal justice services-to ensure better transparency on program costs,
                    management of resources, and protection of the intelligence program.

                The FBI should report regularly to Congress in its semiannual program reviews
                    designed to identify whether each field office is appropriately addressing FBI
                    and national program priorities.
                The FBI should report regularly to Congress in detail on the qualifications,
                    status, and roles of analysts in the field and at headquarters. Congress should
                    ensure that analysts are afforded training and career opportunities on a par
                    with those offered analysts in other intelligence community agencies.
                The Congress should make sure funding is available to accelerate the expansion
                    of secure facilities in FBI field offices so as to increase their ability to use
                    secure email systems and classified intelligence product exchanges. The Congress
                    should monitor whether the FBI's information-sharing principles are implemented
                    in practice.

            The FBI is just a small fraction of the national law enforcement community in the
                United States, a community comprised mainly of state and local agencies. The network
                designed for sharing information, and the work of the FBI through local Joint
                Terrorism Task Forces, should build a reciprocal relationship, in which state and
                local agents understand what information they are looking for and, in return,
                receive some of the information being developed about what is happening, or may
                happen, in their communities. In this relationship, the Department of Homeland
                Security also will play an important part.
            The Homeland Security Act of 2002 gave the under secretary for information analysis
                and infrastructure protection broad responsibilities. In practice, this directorate
                has the job to map "terrorist threats to the homeland against our assessed
                vulnerabilities in order to drive our efforts to protect against terrorist
                threats." These capabilities are still embryonic. The
                directorate has not yet developed the capacity to perform one of its assigned jobs,
                which is to assimilate and analyze information from Homeland Security's own
                component agencies, such as the Coast Guard, Secret Service, Transportation Security
                Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border
                Protection. The secretary of homeland security must ensure that these components
                work with the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate so that
                this office can perform its mission.

            Homeland Defense
            At several points in our inquiry, we asked, "Who is responsible for defending us at
                home?" Our national defense at home is the responsibility, first, of the Department
                of Defense and, second, of the Department of Homeland Security. They must have clear
                delineations of responsibility and authority.
            We found that NORAD, which had been given the responsibility for defending U.S.
                airspace, had construed that mission to focus on threats coming from outside
                America's borders. It did not adjust its focus even though the intelligence
                community had gathered intelligence on the possibility that terrorists might turn to
                hijacking and even use of planes as missiles. We have been assured that NORAD has
                now embraced the full mission. Northern Command has been established to assume
                responsibility for the defense of the domestic United States.

                Recommendation: The Department of Defense and its oversight
                    committees should regularly assess the adequacy of Northern Command's strategies
                    and planning to defend the United States against military threats to the
                    homeland.

            The Department of Homeland Security was established to consolidate all of the
                domestic agencies responsible for securing America's borders and national
                infrastructure, most of which is in private hands. It should identify those elements
                of our transportation, energy, communications, financial, and other institutions
                that need to be protected, develop plans to protect that infrastructure, and
                exercise the mechanisms to enhance preparedness. This means going well beyond the
                preexisting jobs of the agencies that have been brought together inside the
                department.

                Recommendation: The Department of Homeland Security and its
                    oversight committees should regularly assess the types of threats the country
                    faces to determine (a) the adequacy of the government's plans-and the progress
                    against those plans-to protect America's critical infrastructure and (b) the
                    readiness of the government to respond to the threats that the United States
                    might face.

            We look forward to a national debate on the merits of what we have recommended, and
                we will participate vigorously in that debate.
