Sure! Let's focus on the `find` command for this exercise. Here are four interesting command-line options for `find`, along with examples of how to use them on files and directories from `./technical`:

1. Option: `-type`
   - Description: Filters files based on their type.
   - Source: [Linux man page for `find`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)
   - Examples:
     ```shell
     $ find ./technical -type f
      ./technical/911report/chapter-1-hepple.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-1-logical.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-1-np.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-1-s.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-1-vp.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-1.anc
      ./technical/911report/chapter-1.txt
      ./technical/911report/chapter-10-hepple.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-10-logical.xml

      ./technical/911report/chapter-13.2-logical.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-13.2-np.xml


     $ find ./technical -type d
      ./technical
      ./technical/911report

     ```

2. Option: `-empty`
   - Description: The -empty option allows you to search for files or directories that are empty.
   - Source: [Linux man page for `find`](https://man7fi.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)
   - Examples:
     ```shell
     $ find ./technical -type f -empty
      # No files found

     $ find ./technical/911report -type f -empty
     
     # No files found
     ```

3. Option: `-size`
   - Description: Filters files based on their size.
   - Source: [Linux man page for `find`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)
   - Examples:
     ```shell
     $ find ./technical -type f -size +1M
     ./technical/911report/chapter-1-hepple.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-1-np.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-10-hepple.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-11-hepple.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-12-hepple.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-13.1-hepple.xml
      ./technical/911report/chapter-13.2-hepple.xm

     $ find ./technical -type f -size -100k
     ./technical/911report/chapter-1.anc
      ./technical/911report/chapter-10-logical.xml

     ```shell
     $ find ./technical -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \;
           Improve the Transitions between Administrations
            In chapter 6, we described the transition of 2000-2001. Beyond the policy issues we
          described, the new administration did not have its deputy cabinet officers in place
          until the spring of 2001, and the critical subcabinet officials were not confirmed
          until the summer-if then. In other words, the new administration- like others before
          it-did not have its team on the job until at least six months after it took office.

          Recommendation: Since a catastrophic attack could occur with little
              or no notice, we should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national
              security policymaking during the change of administrations by accelerating the
              process for national security appointments. We think the process could be
              improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new
              officials to assume their new responsibilities as quickly as possible.


          Before the election, candidates should submit the names of selected members of
              their prospective transition teams to the FBI so that, if necessary, those team
              members can obtain security clearances immediately after the election is over.
          A president-elect should submit lists of possible candidates for national
              security positions to begin obtaining security clearances immediately after the
              election, so that their background investigations can be complete before January
              20.
          A single federal agency should be responsible for providing and maintaining
              security clearances, ensuring uniform standards-including uniform security
              questionnaires and financial report requirements, and maintaining a single
              database. This agency can also be responsible for administering polygraph tests
              on behalf of organizations that require them.
          A president-elect should submit the nominations of the entire new national
              security team, through the level of under secretary of cabinet departments, not
              later than January 20. The Senate, in return, should adopt special rules
              requiring hearings and votes to confirm or reject national security nominees
              within 30 days of their submission. The Senate should not require confirmation
              of such executive appointees below Executive Level 3.
          The outgoing administration should provide the president-elect, as soon as
              possible after election day, with a classified, compartmented list that
              catalogues specific, operational threats to national security; major military or
              covert operations; and pending decisions on the possible use of force. Such a
              document could provide both notice and a checklist, inviting a president-elect
              to inquire and learn more.

         ```
         
    ```shell
      $ find ./technical -type d -name "dir*" -exec ls -l {} \;
            
            # Nothing
   ```
These examples showcase some commonly used options for the `find` command, allowing you to filter and perform actions on files and directories based on different criteria.
