1. Option: `-type`
   - Description: Filters files based on their type.
   - Source: [Linux man page for `find`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)
   - Examples:
     ```shell
     $ find ./technical -type f
     # This command will find all regular files within the './technical' directory.

     $ find ./technical -type d
     # This command will find all directories within the './technical' directory.
     ```

2. Option: `-name`
   - Description: Matches files and directories based on their names.
   - Source: [Linux man page for `find`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)
   - Examples:
     ```shell
     $ find ./technical -name "*.txt"
     # This command will find all files with the extension '.txt' within the './technical' directory.

     $ find ./technical -name "file*"
     # This command will find all files and directories starting with 'file' within the './technical' directory.
     ```

3. Option: `-size`
   - Description: Filters files based on their size.

     # This command will find all files larger than 1 megabyte within the './technical' directory.

     $ find ./technical -type f -size -100k
     # This command will find all files smaller than 100 kilobytes within the './technical' directory.
     ```

4. Option: `-exec`
   - Description: Executes a command on each file found.
   - Source: [Linux man page for `find`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html)
   - Examples:
     ```shell
     $ find ./technical -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \;
     # This command will find all '.txt' files within the './technical' directory and display their contents using 'cat'.

     $ find ./technical -type d -name "dir*" -exec ls -l {} \;
     # This command will find all directories starting with 'dir' within the './technical' directory and list their detailed information using 'ls -l'.
     ```

These examples showcase some commonly used options for the `find` command, allowing you to filter and perform actions on files and directories based on different criteria.
